## Project Overview
In this module, we built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. We also created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
We customized our webpage using Bootstrap, and equip our table with several fully functional filters that allows users to interact with our visualizations  

## Resources  
- **Data Source:** [data.js](/static/js/data.js) 
- **Software:** VS Code

## Objectives  
- Explain the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript “standard” and JavaScript version ES6+. 
- Describe JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases. 
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions. 
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions. 
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop). 
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML.  

## Summary  
JavaScript is a scripting language that was designed with the purpose to enhance HTML. It allows the user to implement complex features on web pages, such as maps or graphs. 

ECMAScript, also referred to as “ES,” is designed to standardize scripting-languages. JavaScript is the best-known implementation of this standard. This means that ES provides guidelines and rules for JavaScript to follow, such as how a function should be created to run correctly, also known as the **proper syntax.**  
  
ES has had many updates to the language, though the sixth update had a major enhancement to the JavaScript language. It’s commonly known as “ES6+”, “ES2015” or “ECMAScript 2015.” This update included more feaures intended to make software development easier. Some of the features were:  

- developers didn't have to wait for new technology to catch up. Normally, that would be waiting on the user to update their web browser to use the product.  

- ES6 is backward compatible. The developer can write in any version of ES and the program will run.

- Arrow functions. Abbreviated syntax that made object-oriented code easier to write.  
  
The standard set in writing JavaScript code is to keep it consistent. It allows for code clarity. As a developer the readability of our code is the most important thing. It will make projects easier when collaborating or bugs faster to address.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, we created additional filters for the webpage. The advanced filtering capability allows users to filter the data by multiple factors.  

## Challenge Objectives  
- Create, update, and deploy JavaScript functions to provide additional table filters.
- Update and deploy forEach (for loop) to loop through the filters and update them with user input.
- Update and populate the dynamic filters and table using JavaScript and HTML.  

## Challenge Summary  

#### Instructions  
Include five total filters in the table:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape  

## Limitations  
A recommendation for further development would be to filter the other columns. Analysis could be done on the Duration of the sightings and/or the Comments for correlation of events. Also, more user friendly input fields could be built. Such as, drop boxes.
